* A beings brain is composed of two information systems:
  - The corpus: The primal brain. It is responsible for motor autonomous functions such as memory recall, sleep cycles and body 
    maintenance.
  - The dynamic: The ever shifting flow and handle of external information. Partially controlled by the corpus.
